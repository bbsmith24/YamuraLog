[*SparkFun OpenLog Artemis (SPX-15846)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15846)

The OpenLog Artemis is an open source datalogger the comes preprogrammed to automatically log IMU, GPS, serial data, and various pressure, humidity, and distance sensors. All without writing a single line of code! OLA automatically detects, configures, and logs Qwiic sensors. OLA is designed for users who just need to capture a bunch of data to a CSV and get back to their larger project.

Included on every OpenLog Artemis is an IMU for built-in logging of triple axis accelerometer, gyro, and magnetometer. Whereas the original [9DOF Razor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14001) used the old MPU-9250, the OpenLog Artemis uses the latest [ICM-20948](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15335) capable of nearly 1kHz logging of all 9 axis. We then took over a decade of experience with the original [OpenLog](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13712) and took it much farther. Simply power up OpenLog Artemis and all incoming serial data is automatically recorded to a log file. Baud rates up to 921600bps are supported! Additionally, based on feedback from users we've added an onboard RTC so that all data can be time stamped.

OpenLog Artemis is highly configurable over an easy to use serial interface. Simply plug in a USB C cable and open a terminal at 115200kbps. The logging output is automatically streamed to both the terminal and the microSD. Pressing any key will open the configuration menu. 

The OpenLog Artemis automatically scans, detects, configures, and logs various Qwiic sensors plugged into the board (no soldering required!). Currently, auto-detection is supported on the following Qwiic products: 

* uBlox GPS Modules (Lat/Long, Altitude, Velocity, SIV, Time, Date) - [ZED-F9P](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15136), [SAM-M8Q](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15193), [ZOE-M8Q](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15193), [NEO-M9N](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15712), [NEO-M8P-2](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15005)

Very low power logging is supported. OpenLog Artemis can be configured to take readings at 500 times a second, or as slow as 1 reading every 24 hours. You choose! When there is more than 2 seconds between readings OLA will automatically power down itself and the sensors on the bus resulting in a sleep current of approximately 250uA. This means a normal [2Ah battery](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13855) will enable logging for more than 300 days! OpenLog Artemis has built-in LiPo charging set at 450mA/hr.

New features are constantly being added so weâ€™ve released an easy to use firmware upgrade tool. No need to install Arduino or a bunch of libraries, simply open the [Artemis Firmware Upload GUI](https://github.com/sparkfun/Artemis-Firmware-Upload-GUI), load the latest OLA firmware, and add features to OpenLog Artemis as the come out!
